# Data wrangling in R

## Workshop 3 code and activities
May 2024

## Tidying data using Tidyr
```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Tidy data

Example of some table outputs, all displaying the same data
```{r table examples}
##table1
#> # A tibble: 6 × 4
#>   country      year  cases population
#>   <chr>       <int>  <int>      <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
#> 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362
#> 4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898
#> 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583

##table2
#> # A tibble: 12 × 4
#>   country      year type           count

##table3
#> # A tibble: 6 × 3

Only table 1 is tidy as it has the most clear structure of variables and rows and coloumns.

3 rules for making tudy datasets:
- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

Tidy data is useful because:
- Having a consistent data structure makes it easier to learn the tools that work with it, and 
- Having your variables in columns allows R to use its ability to work with vectors of values. This makes transforming tidy data a smoother process.

Filtering data, summarine data and using certain functions in ggplot2 is impossible is the dataframe is not the same format as Table 1 from above.

%>% is a pipe designed to help you better understand what the code is doing. It takes data from the left of the pipe and applied the function. |> does the same thing in base R.

```{r pipe examples}
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
# this creates a new coloumn for the variable rate which is calculated by the command

table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)
#this computes cases per year

#this can be visualised with ggplot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```






## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
