```{r set-up, eval = TRUE, results="hide"}
#set working directory is not necessary for a markdown file
#read in data extracted from original graph
shark <- read.delim("../data/Shark.txt")
shark

str(shark)

library(tidyverse)

shark$Area <- factor(shark$Area)
shark$Species <- factor(shark$Species)
```


```{r changing variables, eval = TRUE}
#get the mean shark and turtle counts and SE for each year across all the areas
sharkav <- shark |> 
  group_by(Year, Species) |>
  summarise(count_av = mean(Count), 
            SE = sd(Count)/sqrt(length(Count))) 
```


```{r building graph, eval = TRUE}
p<-ggplot(sharkav, aes(x = Year, y = count_av, color = Species)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = count_av-SE, ymax = count_av+SE)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightblue4", "darkseagreen")) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Mean catch +/- SE") #+
  #facet_wrap(~ Species, scales = "free_y") this would split the graph into 2: one for sharks and one for turtles in order to display the turtle values more clearly but doesn't suit my question for the data


plot <- p+theme_classic()
