```{r set-up, eval = TRUE, results="hide"}
#set working directory is not necessary for a markdown file
#read in data extracted from original graph
shark <- read.delim("../data/Shark.txt")
shark

str(shark)

library(tidyverse)

shark$Area <- factor(shark$Area)
shark$Year <- factor(shark$Year)
shark$Species <- factor(shark$Species)
```


```{r changing variables, eval = TRUE, r}
#get the average shark and turtle counts for each year across all the areas north of Bundaberg 
if(data$Year == 2014) {
  shark2014 <- (mean(shark$Count)
}


```


```{r building graph, eval = TRUE, r}
ggplot(shark) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = Species, width=5)) +
    facet_wrap(~ Area)

#different graph - doesn't work
p <- ggplot(shark) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = Species))
    
p + geom_jitter()

#different graph - not right, would need to 
ggplot(shark) +
    geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = Species))

#different graph - meh
ggplot(shark, aes(x=Year, y=Count, width=.8)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=Species), position=position_dodge(width = 0.9), stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue4", "seagreen4"))+
  facet_wrap(~ Area)

```

how to save plots:
ggsave("../output/FILENAME.jpg", PLOTNAME, width = 3, height = 2)
